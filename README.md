# Intro-To-Java-Spring-2020
A place to store my school work for spring 2020 

The Student Project covers several weeks of labs.  
Each week added a new feature so I decided to treat 
it as one app with several feature releases to 
practice using github in different environments.
I developed the project on my Windows PC and my
laptop running Linux Mint 18.3 Sylvia.  I used 
Visual Studio Code to develop in both environments.
